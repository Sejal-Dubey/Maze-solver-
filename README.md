# Maze Solver
used graph algorithms to generate and solve maze
# Description
This project aims to explore different algorithms for graphs by generating mazes using random approach which is balanced,graph representation of maze, solving those mazes(finding shortest paths)and avl implementation in BFS to calculate shortest path in maze generated through balanced random approach.
